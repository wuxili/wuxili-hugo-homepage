# About me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>,
working with Prof. <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/">David Z. Pan</a>.
Prior to coming to UT, I graduated from <a href="http://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> with B.S. in Microelectronics in 2013.

I do research in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).
I like developing tools to increase the productivity of circuit designers, improve the quality of modern VLSI systems, and overcome chip design challenges.

I have won the two 1st-place awards of ISPD 2016 and 2017 FPGA placement contests hold by Xilinx.
I have interned at Xilinx, Cadence, Apple, and ARM.
